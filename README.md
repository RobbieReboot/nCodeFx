# nCodeFx

WPF Bitmap effects written in CSharp & [HLSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl)

nCode was my Private Limited Company that I contracted through for ~13 years. This was an attempt at writing a sellable effect pack when WPF couldn't even desaturate bitmaps.
I charged £39 and sold 21 copies (ooooh £819!) before WPF started shipping with inbuild effects. After tax I probably took home £6.37. The year after Google paid £380 in tax. Not that I'm bitter.
